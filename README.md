## Startup Grabber
This is a quick set of scripts to get data from launchcaster.xyz.   clone the repo.  run `npm install` then use node to run the first script (index.js) `node index` let it finish.  (note it uses puppeteer and is currently set to not be headless -- you can adjust this in index.js if you'd like but it's visible for debugging purposes.)   once it's done, it will create a urls.json file.  run the second script `node second.js` and let it run.  Once it's done you'll have an output.csv file you can use with all the collected data.

Enjoy!
